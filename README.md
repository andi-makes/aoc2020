Advent of Code 2020 - My solutions using C++

*Interrested in my solutions from last year? You can find them [here](https://github.com/andi-makes/AdventOfCode2019)!*

# Compilation
 * Create a `build` folder in the root of the project.
 * `cd` into the `build` folder.
 * Run `cmake ..` with your favorite arguments or use a program like `cmake-gui` on Windows or `ccmake` on Linux.
 * To build the program, run `cmake --build <path_to_build_folder>`. (e.g. from the root of the project run `cmake --build build`)
 * The resulting binary will be in the `bin` folder.
 * **WSL specific problem**: To fix `clock skewed` warning, execute `sudo hwclock -s`, that should fix it for a while.
